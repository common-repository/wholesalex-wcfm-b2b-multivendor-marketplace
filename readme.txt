Turn WCFM multivendor marketplace into a B2B multivendor marketplace with WholesaleX - the simplest B2B wholesale solution for WooCommerce.
== Intro ==

WholesaleX for WCFM is a free solution to turn your multivendor marketplace into a B2B multivendor marketplace with ease. Create amazing B2B multivendor marketplaces like Alibaba, SaleHoo, Trayde, etc., with WholesaleX.

== Why Choose WholesaleX for WCFM? ==

WCFM Marketplace is one of the best multivendor marketplaces with minimalistic settings. 

WholesaleX, on the other hand, is the simplest and most complete solution to create an ideal WooCommerce B2B store for wholesaling.

With WholesaleX for WCFM, you can bring the best of both worlds in one place. You can create a successful B2B multivendor marketplace that will make wholesaling business for your vendor hassle-free.

The simplistic nature of WholesaleX and WCFM Marketplace will help the vendors set, moderate and control wholesale prices, discounts, and advanced restrictions on their products. But the site administrator will have complete control over the vendors and can override any discounts set by them-limiting features for the vendors. 

== What You Can Do with this Plugin ==

WholesaleX for WCFM enables the wholesaling (B2B) option for your multi seller store. You can create customizable user roles catered towards B2B, and use the registration form to let the customer register as a B2B user. You can also enable bulk ordering for the customer. 

Also, you can enable specific options for the vendors:

* User role-based wholesale prices: Vendors can set different wholesale prices for different user roles. This means that they can offer special wholesale prices to their wholesale customers.
* Dynamic Rules: Vendors can apply specific pricing and discounts for their customers using the Dynamic Rule feature.
* Built-in conversation system: Vendors can stay in touch with their customers with the built-in conversation system by WholesaleX. This means you can answer questions, resolve issues, and support your customers directly.

== Prerequisites ==

You'll need the following plugins to create the perfect B2B multivendor marketplace:

Once the all plugins are installed and activated, you can create your multivendor marketplace with WCFM and start adding wholesale prices to your products store-wide and let the vendors do the same for their customers only with WholesaleX.
